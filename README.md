# Fresh.ly
Fresh.ly is a neat Web App designed to help the user to track calories as well as food freshness. The intent behind this design is to never waste food while keeping yourself on track to meet your health goals. When the user first enters their food of choice on the day that they buy it, an API is used to track the foods caloric info and the period of time that it takes before your cuisine of choice is no longer edible. To help with your food not going bad you will recive an SMS message (using an additional API) a day before the food goes bad so that you know that you need to prepare a dish involving the food that is about to go bad.
